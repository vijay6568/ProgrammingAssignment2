## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to
## caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeteadly

## Write a short comment describing this function
## Below are 2 functions that are used to create a special object that stores a matrix and caches its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getInverse <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get, setInverse = setInverse, getInverse = getInverse)
}


## Write a short comment describing this function
## This function computes the inverse of the special matrix created by makeCacheMatrix. If the inverse of a matrix has been calculated and the matrix itself has not been modified, then it retrieves the inverse from the cache. 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv <- x$getInverse()
    if (!is.null(inv)) {
      message("getting cached data")
      return(inv)
      }
    matrix <- x$get()
    inv <- solve(matrix, ...)
    x$setInverse(inv)
    inv
}
